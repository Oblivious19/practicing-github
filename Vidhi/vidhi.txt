I'm a 19-year-old with a passion for exploration and learning. I love challenging myself by volunteering in various fields that catch my interest, constantly pushing my abilities to new limits. As an extrovert, I thrive on socializing and engaging in conversations with people from all walks of life, eagerly listening to their perspectives and learning about their passions.
Despite being an engineering student, my hobbies revolve around fashion, makeup, and storytelling. It's quite ironic, but I find immense joy and creativity in these areas. I enjoy immersing myself in the art of storytelling, which makes sense as I have been dancing to classical and western music since the age of 5. These creative outlets provide a refreshing contrast to my academic pursuits. 
I firmly believe that every action, word, and experience contributes to a greater narrative in life. I see life as a captivating plot, with each experience shaping my character and guiding me towards a purposeful journey. This perspective fuels my drive to seize every opportunity, embrace challenges, and extract valuable lessons from each moment.
I believe every step is a stepping stone and serves us for the highest good, while also being the present highest we can feel.
